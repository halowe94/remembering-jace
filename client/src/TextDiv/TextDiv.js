        Jace Young was a 6 year old boy full of life and light. Those who knew
        him well describe him as a child who loved to read, who was always
        dancing, and who was incredibly smart. Jace attended Kipp Bayview and
        had dreams of becoming a computer programmer. Today we remember his
        sweet smile, and though he is gone too soon, there is no doubt that he
        was a blessing to all who knew him.
